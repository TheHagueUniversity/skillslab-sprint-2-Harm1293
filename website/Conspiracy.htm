				<h1> Conspiracy  </h1>
				<p>Although conspiracy theories tend to be seen as social paranoia and tend to be ridiculed in movies and TV-shows one can not deny the interesting aspect behind learning about an alternative explanation for somehting you thought you knew or understood. Not one but many of these theories have become widely accepted and some have also been proven to be true. In this section we will try to focus on bringing these theories forward by focussing equally on the believer's perspective aswell as the the deniers'. </p>

				<h1>  Ten conspiracy theories that turned out to be true  </h1>
				<h2>10: Project MK ultra </h2>
				<p> MK ultra , sometimes referred to as the CIA'S mind control program, is the name given to a program of experiments on human subjects, mostly illegal, designed by the CIA. These experiments were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture. This operation began in the early 1950s and ended in 1973. The methods used to manipulate the subjects' mental states include the administration of LSD, hypnosis, sensory depravation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse as well as other forms of physical torture. It is believed that these methods of mind control are still being used nowadays specially with celebrities and politicians. The video below is an old investigative documentary into this practice it was filmed in the 80's, some years after the informatin about this CIA program was declassified.</p>

				<h2>9:The great diamond conspiracy</h2>
				<p>During the late 1870's, when huge diamond mines were opened in south africa it was suspected that the diamond supply was far greater than what was advertised and that the price of diamonds had been artificialy inflated. Theorists believed that diamonds were actually worthless... and they were spot on! until the 19th century diamons could only be found in very small quantities in riverbeds in India and the jungles in Brazil but when huge diamond mines were found in south africa diamonds began to be mined by the truckloads, very soon the market was flooded with an excessive amount of diamonds the investors realized that the prices of diamonds rested solely on the fact that they were so rare. If too many came to the market their prices would plummet. So what did they do? they realized they had to restict the supply of diamonds to keep the prices high, so in 1888 these investors merged together into a corporation called "De Beers Consolidated Mines" and so they monopolized the global diamond market. How they remained in power was by storing massive amounts of diamonds in werehouses and realeasing only a limited amount yearly, creating an illusion of scarcity. They soon realized that only wealthy individuals were purchasing these diamonds so they needed a way to encourage the working and middle class to buy. In 1938 they came up with the diamond engagement ring and used hollywood movies to propagate the idea of the diamond engagement ring by paying studios to include scenes where young men proposed using diamond rings. The following video by CollegeHumour explains this in a very interesting and funny way.

				<h2>8:Operation Northwoods</h2>
				<p>In 1962 US military intelligence planned terrorist attacks on its own country. US operatives intended to blame these attacks on the Cuban government to justify a war against Cuba. The operation involved hijacking planes and bombing US cities, to gain public support against Cuba’s communist leader, Fidel Castro. This operation was rejected by the Kennedy administration and was forgotten until the 1990s when it was rediscovered during a surge of interest in JFK's assassination and provoked outrage from the public. The official documents can now be found online.</p>

				<h2>7:Big brother conspiracy</h2>
				<p>In 2013 computer analyst Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA was accessing tens of millions of Americans’ online records and tracking phone calls – under the pretence of trying to uncover terrorist plots. Thanks to a report by the washington post and Snowden we now know that 90% of the sentitive data being collected by the NSA is from internet user with absolutely no connection to terrorist activities. When infront of congress, the director of the NSA lied under oath claiming that the NSA did not collect the data of millions of Americans, Snowden has been charged with theft of government property and searched for assylum in Russia.</p>

				<h2>6: Alcohol prohibition dirty play </h2>
				<p>Between 1920 and 1933 in the US was the alcohol prohbition, for 13 years alcoholic beverages were banned. This, however, was very difficult to enforce. Many people started making and distributing their own liquor. The FBI was faced with the challenge to stop people from drinking, then suddenly people started dying from drinking alcoholic beverages. Theories started popping up that claimed that the government or FBI were intentionally poisoning alcoholic drinks to deter people from drinking it. The goal was to demonize alcohol in the eyes of the general public and stop people from wanting to drink. Substances such as kerosine, chloroform and acetone to liquor and people started dying because of this but the general pubic thought it was because of the liquor itself. </p>

				<h2>5:The bohemian grove </h2>
				<p>For years it had been said that the US' wealthiest and most powerful politicians and members of society were meeting yearly in the middle of the woods to perform rituals and to worship a wooden statue of a giant owl.... this turned out to be true. The Bohemian Grove is located in California and it's a 2700 acre camp ground in which this yearly meeting takes place. During the 2 week gathering the attendees get drunk, hire services of male and female prostitutes and perform a mock sacrifice and burning of a child to the 12 ft wood owl statue. Eventhough this is confirmed whatever goes on in these meetings still remains , for the most part,a secret. The following video shows how 2 investigative journalists allegedly infiltrated the grove and managed to film some of it, it also shows interviews with the locals and peple that work near the park.</p>

				<h2>4:The CIA "heart-attack" gun</h2>
				<p> During the 60s and 70s the CIA developed a heart-attack gun, this was revealed in 1976. The gun is powered by a battery and fires a projectile made up of frozen water mixed with shellfish toxins which disolves on impact rendering it untraceable, the only clue left behind by this gun is a small red dot on the point of impact. The toxins that cause death leave barely any trace in the body of the victim.The following video shows testimony and some footage of a court hearing in which representatives of the CIA had to explain the existence of this weapon.</p>

				<h2>3:Operation fast and furious</h2>
				<p>Operation fast and furious refers to a tactic used by the ATF between 2006 and 2011 in the US. The ATF purposely allowed licensed firearms dealers to sell weapons to illegal buyers hoping to track the guns to Mexican drug cartel leaders in order to apprehend them. During the operation the ATF monitored the sale of approximately 2000 fireamrs , of which only 710 were recovered. These firearms have been found in crime scenes on both sides of the border and some have been documented to have been found in Syria.</p>

				<h2>1:CIA aka "druglords" </h2>
				<p>Thanks to the work done by Pullitzer price winner Gary Webb, the CIA's involvement with cocaine trafficking was exposed. Webb revealed that the Raegan administration and the CIA were envolved in cocaine trafficking in central america, the money earned was used to finance the counter rebel group during the war in Nicaragua.
