                <h1>Purpose</h1>
                <p>The purpose of this blog is to cover weekly interesting topics that might be considered important or ignored by most people and to inform individuals on scientific discoveries, technological advantages, geopolitical and economical events and conflict updates from all around the world.</p>

                <h1> Motives </h1>
                <p> In an era of information it has become common for people to be mis-informed, this is unacceptable. The sources we call reliable have been found to be untrustworthy and also to be serving special interests. We the people have given these sources too much power without demanding any responsability from their part. We have placed a blind trust in a manipulative machine that is the mainstream media and have become lazy enough not to fact check the sources of the reports we are receiving from multiple channels, tv and internet included. With this in mind it was decided to put in an extra effort to gather trustworthy sources and different perspectives on issues and topics surrounding our world, not with the intention to make readers think in a certain way but to invite them to fact check and become part of the discussion. Opinions, questions, thoughts and ideas are not only <strong> welcome </strong> but kindly appreciated </p>
