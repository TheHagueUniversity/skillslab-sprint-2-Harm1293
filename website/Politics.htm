                    <h1>Politics </h1>
                    <p>Politics is one of the most difficult subjects to discuss, we tend to not be very open minded regarding the information we receive about political leaders from other countries besides our own. We tend to categorize political views different than democratic as wrong. This leads to a biasedly formed opinion regarding world events which makes us easier to manipulate. The purpose of this page is to inform as many sides of the argument as possible in an objective way. It is important to know and understand both sides of a conflict specially during these times of instability in the international relations between mayor geopolitical players. </p>

                <h1> <strong>Geert Wilders' in trouble</strong> </h1>
                <p> Dutch anti-Islam politician, Geert Wilders, was convicted of insulting and initing discrimination against Maroccans. The court however imposed no penalty on him while clearing him of inciting hatred. Wilders was charged because of a 2014 incident in which he urged his supporters to chant that they wanted "Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!" Moroccans in The Netherlands. This Dutch monority became outraged by these actions and pressed charges.
                    <br> This is not the first time Mr. Wilders has been involved in such matters, in 2011 he was acquitted at another hate speech trial for his criticism of Islam which, according to those who oppose him, overstepped the limits of free speech by specifically targetting Moroccans. He denied these charges and insisted he was performing his political duty by pointing out a problem in the Dutch society.

                    <br> Abdou Menebhi, president of the Euro-Mediterranean Center for Migration and Development, welcomed the verdict. <i>"For us it's a very important verdict,"</i>He told The Associated Press.<i>"This gives Moroccans who felt like victims a renewed belief in a democratic society."</i> He also stated that it also sent a message to Geert Wilders' supporters to be careful. <i>"This man is not looking for solutions for you,His is an ideology of smearing Europe, migrants, Muslims, without offering alternatives."</i>

                    <br>
                    <br> This happens just months before the national elections. Wilders' "Party for Freedom" is leading a nationwide poll of polls and rose in popularity during the trial.
                    <br> Wilders' himself denies any wrongdoing, saying the comments he made, which also included referring to Moroccans as <i>"scum"</i>, are protected as free speech. Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said the court decided not to impose a sentence on Wilders, as the conviction was punishment enough for a democratically -elected lawmaker.
                    <br> Wilder is now planning to appeal his conviction, RTL news reported. He has 2 weeks to do so. He has repeatedly said that his trial is a politically motivated attempt to damage the image of the Dutch Party For Freedom (PPV), which is headed by him and has become the most popular party in opinion polls recently. He quickly released a video message both in English and Dutch, criticizing the judgement and vowing to appeal. <i>"Today, I was convited in a political trial which, shrtly before the elections, attempts to neutralize the leader of the largest and most popular opposition party. They will not succeed."</i>Even before the verdicth Wilders' vowed not to remain silenced <i>"Whatever the verdict, I will continue to speak the truth about the Moroccan problem, and no judge, politician or terrorist will stop me."</i></p>
                <h2> <center>The other side</center></h2>
                <p>Putting opinions and morals aside and by trying to look at the situation from his point of view one can not avoid leaning to the conclusions that this man, Geert Wilders, might not be that far fetched with his opinions and believes.
                    <br> Allow me to elaborate, after the refugee crisis a lot of issues have been brought forward, from the assaults and rapes in Germany during new years eve in 2015 and most recently the rape and murder of a girl in Germany that was committed by a refugee, this does not mean that we have to generalize by any means, it just sheds some light into the fact that the regulations and process into allowing someone to enter a country has to be improved, a better background check and analysis has to be performed in order to filter out the small group of individuals with issues, extreme ideologies or hidden agendas.
                    <br>On December 9th 2016, just hours after Geert Wilders was convicted of insulting and inciting discrimination against Maroccans, the local police in arrested a man in Rotterdam, suspected of planning a terrorist attack. Law enforcement found a Kalashnikov assault rifle and an Islamic State Flag while raiding the man's house.

                    <p>Special forces also seized four boxes containing explosive materials, the suspect's phone and around 1600 Euro. According to the Local Limburger media outlet, the police initially received a tip off from Holland's Algemene Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) intelligence agency.
                        <br> According to a report from 2011 commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Interior,<b>forty percent</b> of Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands between the ages of 12 and 24 have been arrested, fined, charged or otherwise accused of committing a crime during the past five years. In Dutch neighborhoods wherethe majority of residents are Moroccan immigrants the youth crime rate reaches 50%.
                        <br> <strong>The main question that this raises is, who is to blame? does the blame fall entirely on the Moroccan residents? or is it in part just a consequence of faulty processes and support from the government?</strong><br>Why is are these crime rates in this minority so high? Are the opportunities not equally offered or are they not efficiently used and appreciated?  </p>
