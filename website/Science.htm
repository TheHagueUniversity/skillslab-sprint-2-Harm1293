                    <h1> <strong> Science </strong> </h1>
                    <p>Science has been the force that has powered our developement for more than 900 years.A force that has seen it's own exponential growth not only during the industrial revolution but specially in the last hundred years. It is what seems to be religion's achilles heel at times and its support in others. Science is a very important aspect not only for our past and present but more importantly for our fuutre, it is our power to be able to decide which technologies we allow to become part of our lifes and it is our duty to report on scientific advantages that might not be reaching people because of their inconvenience for the established order of power.</p>

                <h1> <strong>TOP 5 SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES OF 2015/2016 </strong> </h1>
                <h2>5. Cause of London's 1952 "Killer fog" revealed</h2>
                <p> In 1952 London's foggy weather turned deadly and nobody knew why... until now. For 5 days in December of 1952 a fog that contained pollutants covered all of London. By the time the fog cleared , more than 150000 people had been hospitalized and atleast 4,000 people had died. Researchers now claim that the number of deaths could well be in the 12,000 counting in all the dead animals.
                    <br>For years researchers have connected the emissions of burning coal with the killer fog, but the specific chemical process had never been explained or discovered. To determine what turned the fog into a killer, an international team of scientists from China, the U.S. and the U.K. recreated the fog in a lab using results from laboratory experiments and atmospheric measurements from beijing and Xi'an, two heavily polluted cities in China. Lead author, Renyi Zhang (atmospheric scientist at Texas A and M Universtity) said that sulfate was a big contributor to London's deadly fog. Sulfuric acid particles, which formed from the sulfur dioxide that was released from the burning of coal, were also a component of the fog. The formation of sulfuric acid was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning and occured initially on natural fog. The ntural fog contained larger particles, with the smaller acidic particles evenly distributed throughout, when those big particles evaporated an acidic haze was left covering the city.

                <h2>4.New massive planet beyond pluto</h2>
                <p>Before the discovery of pluto in the 20th century, it had been theorized that a ninth planet , Planet X, existed beyong Neptune due to the gravitational clustering that could only be caused by a massive object. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology presented evidence that a ninth planet truly does exist with an orbital period of 15,000 years. The researchers have calculated that there is only a 0.007 percent chance that the clustering could be a coincidence. If it does exist the planet could be 2-15 times bigger than earth and orbit between 200 and 1600 Astronomical Units (AU) from the sun. An AU is 150,000,000 kilometers, which means the planet could orbit as far from the sun as 240,000,000,000 kilometers.

                <h2>3.SpaceX successfully lands a rocket vertically </h2>
                <p>In movies, TV and games it's very common for a spaceship to land and take flight as it pleases almost effortlessly and without complications. The reality however is very different, most rockets end up in the sea after their usage which have to be then recovered (at very high expenses) in order to salvage some usable parts. Sometimes these rockets or parts of them are purposefully burned in the atmosphere. The ability to land a rocket vertically means that it could be cheaply and easily re-used, which could save an incredible amount of money.
                    <br> The private company SpaceX successfully landed a rocket vertically in December (2015) they did so on a floating autonomous drone ship. This simbolizes one of the biggest leaps of humanity when it comes to space exploration, though it's still a baby step, it opens the doors to having service stations in space, the moon or other planets, that will allow spaceships to make a quick stop to cntinue onto their journey... the possibilities are endless.The following video by the spceX channel shows the exact moment of the landing

                <h2>2.CRISPR gene-editing advancements </h2>
                <p>CRISPR, short for <i><b>"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats"</b></i> is a new method of gene-editing. It's cheap, quick and relatively easy to use and can also be used with a wide variety of organisms, including humans. The potential this method has are endless and somewhat futuristic, from editing disease out of our genome, to improving physical aspects of an organisms body like muscle mass, height, and overall intelligence. to genetically modifying crops.
                    <br> Researchers at Harvard used CRSPR to successfully splice Woolly Mammoth DNA into the genome of an Asian elephant. Researchers at UC San Diego used CRSPR on fruit flies to create a gene drive, which is when one genetic modification is quickly spread through an entire population, Gene drives have massive potential, for example, if a gene drive is used with moquitoes it could be used to wipe out malarya carrying populations. And last but not least, Chinese scientists used CRSPR to modify the genomes of non-viable human embryos. It was the first time this technology was used on human DNA and it was very successful. Human gene editing could erradicate disease but any genetic change will also be heritable as would any unintended side effects. This has sparked a world-wide ethical debate and it appears that it will continue for years to come.

                <h2>1.Physicists detect gravitaniotal waves, Confirming Einstein's theory</h2>
                <p> In 1915, Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves as part of his general theory of relativity, these waves remained hipothetical until 2015 when the researchers of LIGO (Laser Interfometer Gravitanional-wave Observatory) announced that they had indeed measured these waves thus confirming Einstein's prediction. These waves were the results of the collision between two black holes, which occured 1.5 billion years ago. When these waves finally hit earth they distorted space like a "Jell-O" allowing the laser measure devices at LIGO to detect these distortions. The LIGO devices are the most powerful measurement tool that currently exist, being able to detect distortions of less than one-thousand the size of a proton!
                    <br> Why is this discovery so important?
                    <br> Well, it is the first measurement of the collision between 2 black holes, this data is gonna help researchers explore the dark space and it will help researchers understand how fast the universe is expanding and how stars explode. The following video shows the announcement of this important discovery by David Reitze of LIGO.
